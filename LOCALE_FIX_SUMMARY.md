# Locale Prefix Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was throwing errors when accessing routes like `/dashboard` because they were missing the required locale prefix (`/ar/` or `/en/`).

**Error:** `Application error: a server-side exception has occurred`

## Root Cause
Many components were using the standard Next.js `Link` and `useRouter` from `next/link` and `next/navigation`, which don't automatically add locale prefixes. The project uses `next-intl` which provides localized navigation components.

## Solution
Updated all internal links and navigation to use the localized components from `@/i18n/navigation`.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/components/custom/sidebar.tsx`
- **Changed:** Import statement
- **From:** `import Link from "next/link"`
- **To:** `import { Link, usePathname, useRouter } from "@/i18n/navigation"`
- **Also fixed:** Logout redirect from `/login` to `/` (home page)

### 2. `/components/custom/pricing-cards.tsx`
- **Changed:** Import statement
- **From:** `import Link from "next/link"`
- **To:** `import { Link } from "@/i18n/navigation"`

### 3. `/app/(public)/[locale]/pricing/PlanCard.tsx`
- **Changed:** Import statement
- **From:** `import Link from "next/link"`
- **To:** `import { Link } from "@/i18n/navigation"`

### 4. `/components/SubscriptionPlans.tsx`
- **Changed:** Import statement for router
- **From:** `import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'`
- **To:** `import { useRouter } from "@/i18n/navigation"`

### 5. `/components/WatermarkRibbon.tsx`
- **Added:** Import statement `import { Link } from "@/i18n/navigation"`
- **Changed:** `<a href="/pricing">` to `<Link href="/pricing">`

### 6. `/components/GatingBanner.tsx`
- **Added:** Import statement `import { Link } from "@/i18n/navigation"`
- **Changed:** `<a href="/pricing">` to `<Link href="/pricing">`

### 7. `/components/landing/HomeTemplate.tsx`
- **Changed:** Import statement
- **From:** `import Link from 'next/link'`
- **To:** `import { Link } from '@/i18n/navigation'`

## How It Works

The localized navigation components from `@/i18n/navigation` are created using `next-intl`'s `createNavigation()` function:

```typescript
// i18n/navigation.ts
import { createNavigation } from 'next-intl/navigation';
import { routing } from './routing';

export const { Link, usePathname, useRouter, redirect } =
  createNavigation(routing);
```

These components automatically:
- ‚úÖ Prepend the current locale to all hrefs
- ‚úÖ Maintain locale when navigating
- ‚úÖ Handle locale switching seamlessly

## Examples of Fixed Links

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `/dashboard` | `/ar/dashboard` or `/en/dashboard` |
| `/pricing` | `/ar/pricing` or `/en/pricing` |
| `/sign-in` | `/ar/sign-in` or `/en/sign-in` |
| `/sign-up` | `/ar/sign-up` or `/en/sign-up` |

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, test these routes:
- [ ] https://sharayeh.com/ar/dashboard (should work)
- [ ] https://sharayeh.com/en/dashboard (should work)
- [ ] https://sharayeh.com/ar/pricing (should work)
- [ ] https://sharayeh.com/en/pricing (should work)
- [ ] Click "Dashboard" link in navbar (should navigate to localized dashboard)
- [ ] Click sidebar links (should maintain locale)
- [ ] Click "Upgrade" links in banners (should navigate to localized pricing)

## Future Prevention

**Always use these imports for internal navigation:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use localized navigation
import { Link, useRouter, usePathname, redirect } from '@/i18n/navigation';

// ‚ùå WRONG - Don't use these for internal links
import Link from 'next/link';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
```

## Deployment Status

- **Commit:** `d84ba68`
- **Pushed to:** `origin/main`
- **Status:** Deploying to Vercel (2-3 minutes)

All links should now work correctly with proper locale prefixes! üéâ
